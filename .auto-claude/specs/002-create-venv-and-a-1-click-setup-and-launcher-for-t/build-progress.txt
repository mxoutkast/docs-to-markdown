=== AUTO-BUILD PROGRESS ===

Project: docs-to-markdown
Workspace: managed by orchestrator
Started: 2026-01-01T07:45:00Z

Workflow Type: feature
Rationale: This is a feature addition that creates new automation scripts to enhance user experience. It does not modify existing functionality but adds setup and launch scripts.

Session 1 (Planner):
- Created implementation_plan.json
- Phases: 3
- Total subtasks: 5
- Created init.sh

Phase Summary:
- Setup Scripts: 2 subtasks, depends on []
- Launcher Scripts: 2 subtasks, depends on []
- Documentation Update: 1 subtask, depends on [phase-1-setup-scripts, phase-2-launcher-scripts]

Services Involved:
- main: CLI application for converting documents to Markdown

Parallelism Analysis:
- Max parallel phases: 2
- Recommended workers: 2
- Parallel groups: [phase-1-setup-scripts, phase-2-launcher-scripts]
- Reason: Both phases create independent scripts with no dependencies between them

Context Files Created/Updated:
- project_index.json: Updated with complete project structure
- context.json: Updated with patterns and files to create/modify

Key Findings from Codebase Investigation:
- Project is a single-service Python CLI application
- Uses standard Python venv for virtual environment
- Package structure with console script entry point in pyproject.toml
- Dependencies: mammoth, markdownify, beautifulsoup4, lxml
- Testing framework: pytest
- No existing setup or launcher scripts found
- Manual setup documented in README.md

=== STARTUP COMMAND ===

To continue building this spec, run:

  source .venv/bin/activate && python auto-claude/run.py --spec 002 --parallel 2

Note: On Windows PowerShell:
  .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
  python auto-claude\run.py --spec 002 --parallel 2

=== SESSION 2 (Implementation - Subtask 1-1) ===
Started: 2026-01-01T07:50:00Z

Subtask: subtask-1-1 - Create setup.bat for one-click environment setup
Status: COMPLETED

Implementation Details:
- Created setup.bat with comprehensive one-click setup functionality
- Script features:
  * Checks for Python installation and version
  * Handles existing .venv (prompts to recreate or skip)
  * Creates virtual environment using python -m venv .venv
  * Activates virtual environment
  * Installs dependencies from requirements.txt
  * Installs package in editable mode (pip install -e .)
  * Optionally installs dev dependencies from requirements-dev.txt
  * Provides clear progress messages and error handling
  * Includes pause at end for user to review output
  * Uses %~dp0 for script directory reference (no hardcoded paths)

Verification:
- Manual testing confirmed all commands work correctly:
  * python -m venv .venv - SUCCESS
  * python -m pip install -r requirements.txt - SUCCESS
  * python -m pip install -e . - SUCCESS
  * python -m docs_to_markdown --help - SUCCESS

Quality Checklist:
- [x] Follows patterns from reference files (README.md)
- [x] No console.log/print debugging statements
- [x] Error handling in place (Python check, venv creation, pip install)
- [x] Verification passes (manual testing completed)
- [x] Clean commit with descriptive message

Git Commit:
- Commit hash: 9f27612

Next Steps:
- Continue with subtask-1-2: Create setup.ps1 for PowerShell environment setup
- Or proceed to phase-2: Launcher Scripts (can be done in parallel)

=== SESSION 3 (Implementation - Subtask 1-2) ===
Started: 2026-01-01T07:55:00Z

Subtask: subtask-1-2 - Create setup.ps1 for PowerShell environment setup
Status: COMPLETED

Implementation Details:
- Created setup.ps1 with comprehensive PowerShell setup functionality
- Script features:
  * Checks for Python installation and version using PowerShell syntax
  * Handles existing .venv (prompts to recreate or skip)
  * Creates virtual environment using python -m venv .venv
  * Activates virtual environment using proper PowerShell activation script path
  * Installs dependencies from requirements.txt
  * Installs package in editable mode (pip install -e .)
  * Provides clear progress messages with colored output (PowerShell host features)
  * Includes error handling with try/catch blocks
  * Uses $PSScriptRoot for script directory reference (no hardcoded paths)
  * Includes Read-Host at end for user to review output
  * Uses proper PowerShell control flow (if/else instead of goto)

Key Differences from setup.bat:
- Uses PowerShell-specific syntax (Write-Host with colors, try/catch, etc.)
- Uses $PSScriptRoot instead of %~dp0
- Uses if/else control flow instead of goto labels
- More sophisticated error handling with try/catch blocks
- Colored output for better user experience (Cyan for headers, Yellow for progress, Green for success, Red for errors)

Verification:
- Manual testing confirmed all commands work correctly:
  * python -m venv .venv - SUCCESS
  * python -m pip install -r requirements.txt - SUCCESS
  * python -m pip install -e . - SUCCESS
  * docs-to-markdown --help - SUCCESS
- Script successfully handles existing .venv by prompting user
- Script properly activates virtual environment and installs dependencies
- All error handling tested and working

Quality Checklist:
- [x] Follows patterns from reference files (README.md)
- [x] No console.log/print debugging statements
- [x] Error handling in place (Python check, venv creation, pip install)
- [x] Verification passes (manual testing completed)
- [x] Clean commit with descriptive message
